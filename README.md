# REACT - TIC TAC TOE Game - html, css, js, react

This is the result of the official React tutorial on their page.
I think it is a good thing to do these official tutorials because not only do they give a broadstroke overview of what React does, can do and what it is.. it also provides one with proper inside info that might get lost in outside tutorials.

Following a tutorial should not be that hard, but to get the concept of it is a different thing and this was a medium because it is still very new and it does take time to learn.
